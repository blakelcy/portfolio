              <p>While I am well versed in the different prototyping tools such as Sketch and Adobe Xd, Figma is free!
                Plus Figma comes with plenty of powerful amenities that helps you. Their auto layout feature is 
                fantastic and being able to build out a component inventory really speeds up design.</p>

              <h2>Latest Read</h2>
              <p>My latest read come straight from Erik Kennedy and his article on common logo mistakes. 
                As someone who is more focused on web layout and design, logo design is an exciting mystery. 
                I hope with some research and practice I will be able to come up with a logo for this site!</p>
