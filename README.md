# Casey Portfolio Website in SvelteKit

Here's what you need to remember dumbass.

## Clone the project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

## Developing

Branch off main (yeah need to change this propably), then use this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the dev server

## Deploying

Merge all branches into main. Once in main run these commands:

```bash
npm run build

```

Then do your basic git commands to add and push followed by

```bash
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run deploy
```

This will create the docs folder and then deploy to gh-pages
