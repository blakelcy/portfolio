      <h3>Fresh For Everyone</h3>
      <div class="section-text col-cnt-2">
        <p>
          <strong>"Fresh for Everyone"</strong> is more than just a slogan; it's
          the brand ethos that Kroger operates under. This universal tagline, in
          its simplicity and directness, is crafted to immediately convey an understanding
          of the uniquely egalitarian nature of the American brand. It underscores
          Kroger’s unwavering commitment and deeply rooted belief that everyone should
          have access to food that is not only fresh and affordable, but also delicious.
          This commitment forms the cornerstone of the brand's identity, shaping
          its operations and initiatives across all levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a heavy focus on product design and design lead mentality, Kroger
          has two pillars that they focus their design experience on. Customer
          Experience and Associate Experience. CX focused on the customers
          journey when shopping online via the website or apps. AX focused on
          the experience of the tools the associates used to perform their jobs.
          I worked for AX for their fresh departments: Bakery, Deli, Meat &
          Seafood.

          hats, trying to keep the project moving forward. Once the three came together,
          progress of the app sped along.

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>
        <strong>Updating Old Processes.</strong> In 2020, the world shut down for
        most people. Remote work became the new normal and software companies thrived.
        Kroger was in a unique situation however. While the general operations employees
        could work their jobs remotely, their in-store associates were considered
        front line workers and had to go in to stores. This disrupted how much product
        designers were able to validate their solutions as access to their core users
        was limited by safety regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such was the state of the product I enherited when joining Kroger in
        early 2021. <strong>Fresh Production</strong> was the app being created to
        replace the old hardware and process for bakery associates to plan the amount
        of stock they needed for a given day. The team had seen heavy turnover in
        key leadership positions leading to a slow progress due to lack of direction.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <div class="article-text">
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        I set about getting familiar with the current state of the app and how
        user's were reacting to it. We had five test stores using our app, one
        of which was local to me in Cincinnati, OH. Another was in Michigan. The
        rest were out of state. For those I set up Teams calls to discuss
        ceertain flows of the app and get feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking to users is one of the best parts about being a Product
        Designer. You get to experience how that person interacts wih your app,
        see their reactions and hopefully find out real problems they have that
        you can solve. In Kroger's case, I was fortunate enough to see how their
        bakery associates worked and what they had to do on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the two stores I was able to go in to, the Cincinnati store did not
        like, trust or use the app. The Michigan store used the app but didn't
        trust the data. These interviews gave way to our first set of goals.

    <h3>App Breakdown</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        <strong>The Three Tasks.</strong> Bakery associates were tasked with three
        methods of stocking goods on the floor. Today's preperation, tomorrow's preperation
        and thawing freezer items. Each one would show what food they needed to prepare,
        and how much. The associate then needed to enter in the amount they actually
        prepared for the day.

        Often times the associates would over produce claiming that the

    <h3>Iteration to Enterprise</h3>
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>
        At first, my process was simple, and in truth laid the foundation of how
        the app evolved. I would walk in to a store, quick meet and greet with
        the department lead and associates, determine who was performing what
        task both on the app and physically, ask some initial questions or
        perform a user testing interview on a new flow, then proceed to get out
        of the way as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind this was early 2021, Covid 19 had hit everyone hard,
        especially front line workers, the very associates I would be talking
        to. You don’t need me to tell you just how overworked these people were,
        but I will. They were overworked and understaffed to a level that anyone
        not working in one of these front lines can’t understand. While I
        couldn’t help with that, I realized I would be the one helping them in
        other ways, making their job as easy as possible through this app, and
        advocating on their behalf to drive features and functionality that will
        ultimately ease their day to day.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-text">
    <div class="paragraph col-cnt-2">
      <p>
        The app was pretty simple at this point, you had some set tasks to
        perform, once you start the task, the app tells you how much you need to
        make of that product that day. Once you made the product you would then
        confirm the amount you made, either more or less than recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I talked to the users, what was found confirmed what we expected. Our
        numbers were different than what they were used to and that they
        couldn’t use it for any of their frozen products. We knew we had to
        solve for frozen products, more on that later, and we assumed our
        numbers were more accurate than what the associates were doing. We had
        numbers and algorithms on our side, all they had were decades of
        experience and knowledge about their community. Clearly we were wrong
        and we started on the journey to make this app better.

  <div class="section-title">
    <h3>Design Solution</h3>
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>
        After talking and visiting with the associates in the store, it was now
        time to solve any issues we uncovered and felt were priority for the
        team. We first would add a story to our backlog, assigned to me so that
        I can start mocking out a potential solution. Since we had such a robust
        Design System in place, most of my “low fidelity” wireframes were more
        in the “high fidelity” realm. Often times I would just “sketch” in
        Sketch, our chosen design tool. For more complex issues, or for newer,
        non design system components, I would revert to pen and paper to quickly
        hash out ideas. For the beginning of this app however, we had the design
        in place. The problems came from accuracy of numbers and user adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that frozen problem I previously mentioned, it came down to not
        being able to know the difference between what was in the freezer and
        what was thawed and placed on the shelf for the customers to pick up.
        Our back end systems had no distinction. The solution was for the
        associate to do a salesfloor count first thing in the morning and then
        do their regular activities. This would keep a consistent production
        number within our app.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-text">
    <div class="paragraph col-cnt-2">
      <p>
        We had most of the components created so it became more about the
        experience of the solution. We wanted this to be as easy and quick as
        possible to avoid the associate feeling that they are just doing another
        scan. Eventually we were able to expand this and integrate into other
        apps that performed scans, but that was a long journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our MVP to get this tested ended up being a one time setup where the
        associate would print out a unique barcode, stick it to their physical
        table, and scan in items to that table. Once that setup was complete
        then the daily interaction for their frozen product would be to scan the
        barcode on the table, count the products on that table, and then get a
        more accurate production number for the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly prototyped the screens out and did an initial user test using
        InVision.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="section-title">
    <h3>The Testing</h3>
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>
        My process for testing was to slap the mockups into InVision, do some
        basic interactions, and pull it up on my phone to walk the associates
        through the new screens, asking questions along the way. For the most
        part I would give the associate a high level overview of what they are
        going to be seeing with the problem we are hoping to solve, but largely
        let them interact with the prototype on their own and observe any
        struggles they encounter or any validations of the designs.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-text">
    <div class="paragraph col-cnt-3">
      <p>
        Testing proved to be a little tricky to work through. Often times they
        would notice things like wrong product imagery or incorrect product in
        the activity which would distract them from what it was I was trying to
        test. Or they wouldn’t be sure what was tappable or not, a limitation of
        the prototyping tool and how I would not wire up the sections of the app
        I wasn’t trying to test.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the new counting feature, I tested in a few stores that weren’t
        familiar with the app to get a fresh impression, as well as another trip
        to Michigan to test with our highest usage store. Using the process I
        mentioned above, I collected the feedback from the associates. Most of
        the non-familiar associates were comfortable with the process and
        understood the need and the outcome. For our Michigan store, they were
        not overly excited about having to count more, but said the process
        seemed quick and easy enough to complete. We found that giving them
        control of their table and products, correlating that the count they
        perform directly impacts the amount they will produce, greatly increased
        the trust in the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we were satisfied with the feedback, we worked on developing this
        new process. Once development was finished we did another round of
        testing with the actual device in our test stores. This allowed us to
        continually fix issues, create new enhancements, and ultimately push
        this app out to all bakery departments across the country.
