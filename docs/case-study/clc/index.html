          from reservations to reporting and reconciliation.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Requests.</strong> CLC approached BDO, the company I was
          working for, asking for us to review their app, figure out what
          improvements needed to be made and present a few updated concept
          mockups to them. It was decided to run a <i>Heuristic Analysis</i> of their
          current mobile application as a guide for improvements to be made.</p></div></section> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-b12ekt"><div class="flex-img svelte-b12ekt"><img style="max-width: 111px" src="../../assets/headshotCasey.png" alt="" class="svelte-b12ekt"> <p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Casey Blakely.</strong> Senior Analyst and Designer/Researcher,

          redesign of their Android and iOS app.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">A new team member was added, Nia-Simone Ecleston, and together Casey
          led discovery sessions to uncover further understanding of the app&#39;s

          support from Nia-Simone (right). Discovery sessions were set up to go over
          individual app screens and potential changes. Nia-Simone was then able
          to redesign screens with oversight and support from Casey. Casey was then
          able to assist in development efforts by being the analyst/designer, making
          sure changes were understood.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Guidelines.</strong> The last deliverable was a guideline document
          outlining the design changes made by the design team. Since I was a contractor,
          I wanted to make sure there was a reference for CLC if I was no longer
          engaged with them.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">Outlined in the document were typography, color and spacing usages.
          Additional common components were called out, so CLC was aware of what
          had already been created, hopefully reducing the creation of new
          one-off designs.</p></div></div></div></nav> <div class="wrapper svelte-b12ekt" data-svelte-h="svelte-535apd"><section class="section-title svelte-b12ekt"><h3 class="svelte-b12ekt">Heuristic Analysis</h3> <div class="section-text"><p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Jakob Nielson.</strong> For the analysis I first used Nielson’s 10
        Usability Heuristics as a reference. Using this foundation I started breaking
        out the app by its different flows and screens. I identified the major flow:
        Login, Search, Hotel Details, and Booking. Alongside this flow were a multitude
        of one-off screens that performed various status or administrative features
        for the user.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">From there I decided to break the flow into the four different micro
        flows and perform the analysis on each. I gave each screen in the flow a
        status; <strong>Good, Poor, Fail.</strong> From there I broke the flow down
        into the four different micro flows and perform the analysis on each. I gave
        each screen in the flow a status;</p></div></section> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-b12ekt"><div class="paragraph col-cnt-2 svelte-b12ekt"><p class="svelte-b12ekt">After doing this for the entirety of the app I created a PowerPoint
        presentation to show to the client.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Findings.</strong> Overall, the app was mostly in need of a fresh
        UI with more consistency between component usage. One key issue was it was
        pretty poor at letting the user know what the error was, leading to frustrations.
        These frustrations were clearly shown in the app&#39;s reviews. Additionally,
        there were components that looked like they were a button and yet it acted
        as a tab. What created further confusion was that there were other versions
        of tabs that made the interaction uncertain.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">In addition to the heuristic analysis, I created a set of concept
        mockups for the Search, Hotel Details, and Hotel Booking screens.</p></div> <img src="../../assets/productImages/clc/figure1.png" alt="" class="sm svelte-b12ekt"> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-b12ekt">Example slide from the Heuristic Analysis for CLC</figure></div> <div class="section-title svelte-b12ekt"><h3 class="svelte-b12ekt">Concept Mockups</h3> <div class="paragraph"><p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Competitor Analysis.</strong> Since I didn’t have access to any users,
        I would have to rely more on my experience and the designs of other competitor
        apps. I downloaded and went through a myriad of similar apps: Hopper, Booking.com,
        Expedia, HotelTonight.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">I liked how HotelsTonight’s search UI functioned as well as Booking.com,
        since they themselves had just done a redesign.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">Using these apps in conjunction with my analysis findings, I quickly put
        together some concept mocks, making sure to focus on spacing,
        typographical hierarchy and a modern consistency.</p></div></div> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-b12ekt"><div class=""><p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Reaction.</strong> I presented the Analysis findings along with the

          best estimate of how many screens there were and what the effort of each
          screen would be. I created a sitemap of the app. From there I estimated
          the effort of each; SM - MD - LG. Once that list was complete and agreed
          upon with the Project Lead of CLC I set about creating repeating meetings
          to start discussing each part of the app.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">I prioritized what I thought were the most important screens to
          update. This was done in part to let developers start working on the
          more critical logic changes, as well as if budget or time ran out I
          had the more important screens updated. After talking with the PL, I
          wanted to make sure this was more of a refreshed UI rather than a
          complete overhaul. Some UX improvements may not be able to be
          implemented.</p></div> <img src="../../assets/productImages/clc/figure3.png" style="max-width: 500px;" alt="" class="svelte-b12ekt"> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-b12ekt">Mural canvas for CLC discoveries (not all shown)</figure></div></div> <div class="article-text grid-col-3 svelte-b12ekt"><div class=""><p class="svelte-b12ekt">I lead the discovery sessions with support from Nia-Simone. The goal
        each time for me was to fully understand how that page or flow
        functioned, and if there were any hidden screens that I was not aware of
        due to permissions or certain criteria being met.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>Development.</strong> As the lead, I oversaw answering any questions
        our development team had. They had been building the app for CLC for some
        time so there was plenty of questions from them. To my knowledge there was
        never an active designer on the development team so there were a few hurdles
        to work through.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">As mentioned, my aim was not to affect too much of the current logic,
        but instead update UI where I could. Some changes were pushed back on
        from the development team but overall, the changes were seen as an
        improvement that could be completed.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">Attending the SCRUM rituals became part of my tasks, walking through and
        sizing stories, attending standup, and answering questions on top of
        finishing out discovery sessions.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">Additionally, I implemented a design review meeting as a way to make
        sure the development team was transitioning to the new structure.
        Changes like spacing or typography were not adapted as quickly as color
        changes for them.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">Overall, the team was progressing, albeit slowly. The decision was made
        to add on additional developers from my company to speed up the process.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">The design team was able to come in under budget which allowed for me to
        spend some additional time with the development team and stakeholder,
        making sure nothing was missed or inaccurately developed.</p></div></div></div> <div class="wrapper svelte-b12ekt" data-svelte-h="svelte-u43lcd"><div class="section-title grid-col-3 svelte-b12ekt"><h3 class="svelte-b12ekt">Redesigned Mockups</h3> <div class=""><div class="col-cnt-2 svelte-b12ekt"><p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>A new UI.</strong> I created many new components and UI elements
          for the redesign, however to save on time I chose to simply have user stories
          created for the smaller screens. In those stories I would call out the
          new UI pattern to be used with the correct spacing in place.</p> <p class="svelte-b12ekt">This worked well but ultimately cost about the same amount of time due
          to changes being needed after reviewing design from the development
          team.</p></div> <img src="../../assets/productImages/clc/hrz-figure4.png" alt="" class="svelte-b12ekt"> <figure class="img-figure-text center svelte-b12ekt">Redesigned screens of the major flow</figure></div></div> <div class="section-title grid-col-3 svelte-b12ekt"><div class="test"><img src="../../assets/productImages/clc/figure5.png" alt="" class="svelte-b12ekt"> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-b12ekt">Previous screens of the major flow</figure></div></div> <div class="section-title grid-col-3 svelte-b12ekt"><h3 class="svelte-b12ekt">Guidelines and handoffs</h3> <div class=""><div class="col-cnt-2 svelte-b12ekt"><p class="svelte-b12ekt"><strong>References.</strong> As part of my deliverable, I created both
          a pdf and a prototype guidelines document for CLC. All mockups were created
          using Adobe xD. The guidelines document was interactive and included an
          introduction for the guideline, page structure, brand colors, typography
          and icons as well as some of the more common components like buttons or
