          engaged with them.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">Outlined in the document were typography, color and spacing usages.
          Additional common components were called out so CLC was aware of what
          has already been created, hopefully reducing the creation of new one

        10 Usability Heuristics as a reference. Using this foundation I started breaking
        out the the app by it’s different flows and screens. I identified the major
        flow: Login, Search, Hotel Details, and Booking. Alongside this flow were
        a multitude of one off screens that performed various status or administrative
        features for the user.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">From there I decided to break the flow into the four different micro
        flows and perform the analysis on each. I gave each screen in the flow a
        status; Good, Poor, Fail. If the screen didn’t pass a particular
        heuristic I marked and explained why.</p></div></section> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-eif2z8"><div class="paragraph col-cnt-2 svelte-eif2z8"><p class="svelte-eif2z8">After doing this for the entirety of the app I created a PowerPoint
        presentation to show to the client.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8"><strong>Findings.</strong> Overall the app was mostly in need of a fresh
        UI with more consistency between component usage. Some key issues of note
        were it was pretty poor at letting the user know what the error was, leading
        to frustrations. These frustrations were clearly shown in the apps reviews.
        Additionally there were components that looked like they were a button for
        example, and yet it acted as a tab. However there were other UI versions
        of tabs making the interaction confusing.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">In addition to the heuristic analysis, I created a set of concept
        mockups for the Search, Hotel Details, and Hotel Booking screens.</p></div> <img src="${s}/assets/figure1.png" alt="" class="svelte-eif2z8"/> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-eif2z8">Example slide from the Heuristic Analysis for CLC</figure></div> <div class="section-title svelte-eif2z8"><h3 class="svelte-eif2z8">Concept Mockups</h3> <div class="paragraph"><p class="svelte-eif2z8"><strong>Competitor Analysis.</strong> I decided since I didn’t have access

        of other competitor apps. I downloaded and went through a meriad of apps:
        Hopper, Booking.com, Expedia, HotelTonight.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">I really liked how HotelsTonight’s search UI functioned as well as
        Booking.com, since they themselves had just done a redesign.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">Using these apps in conjunction with my analysis findings, I quickly put
        together some concept mocks, making sure to focus on spacing,
        typographical hierarchy and a modern consistency.</p></div></div> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-eif2z8"><div class=""><p class="svelte-eif2z8"><strong>Reaction.</strong> I presented the Analysis findings along with the

          the best estimate of how many screens there were and what the effort of
          each screen would be. I first created a sitemap of the app. From there
          I estimated out the effort of each; SM - MD - LG. Once that list was complete
          and agreed upon with the Project Lead of CLC I set about creating repeating
          meetings to start discussing each part of the app.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">We first prioritized what we thought were the more important screens
          to update. This was done in part to let developers start working on
          some of the more critical logic changes as well as if budget or time
          ran out we had the more important screens updated. After talking with
          the PL, we wanted to make sure this was more of a refreshed UI rather
          than a complete overhaul. Some UX improvements may not be able to be
          implemented.</p></div> <img src="${s}/assets/figure3.png" alt="" class="svelte-eif2z8"/> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-eif2z8">Mural canvas for CLC discoveries (not all shown)</figure></div></div> <div class="article-text grid-col-2 svelte-eif2z8"><div class=""><p class="svelte-eif2z8">I lead the discovery sessions with support from Nia-Simone. The goal
        each time for me was to fully understand how that page or flow
        functioned, and if there were any hidden screens that I was not aware of
        due to permissions or certain criteria being met.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8"><strong>Development.</strong> As the lead I also was in charge of answering
        any questions our development team had. They had been building the app for
        CLC for some time so there was plenty of questions from them. To my knowledge
        there was never an active designer on the development team so there were
        a few hurdles to work through.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">As mentioned our aim was not to affect too much of the current logic,
        but instead update UI were we could. Some changes were pushed back on
        from the development team but overall the changes were seen as an
        improvement that could be completed.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">Attending the SCRUM rituals became part of my tasks, walking through and
        sizing stories, attending standup, and answering questions on top of
        finishing out discover sessions.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">Additionally I made sure to implement a design review meeting as a way
        to make sure the development team was transitioning to the new
        structure. Changes like spacing or typography were not adapted as
        quickly as color changes for them.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">Overall the team was progressing, albeit slowly. We made the decision to
        add on additional developers from my company to speed up the process.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">The design team was able to come in under budget which allowed for me to
        spend some additional time with the development team and stakeholder,
        making sure nothing was missed or inaccurately developed.</p></div></div> <section class="section-title svelte-eif2z8"><h3 class="svelte-eif2z8">Departure</h3> <div class="section-text"><p class="svelte-eif2z8"><strong>Moving on.</strong> Before I could see the redesign fully implemented,
        I made the decision to leave my company BDO.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">As of the time of writing this study, I am unable to determine if the
        full redesign has been implemented.</p></div></section> <div class="section-title grid-col-3 svelte-eif2z8"><h3 class="svelte-eif2z8">Redesigned Mockups</h3> <div class=""><div class="col-cnt-2 svelte-eif2z8"><p class="svelte-eif2z8"><strong>A new UI.</strong> We created a lot of new components and UI elements
          for the redesign, however to save on time we chose to simply have user
          stories created for the smaller screens. In those stories we would call
          out the new UI pattern to be used with the correct spacing in place.</p> <p class="svelte-eif2z8">This worked well for the most part but ultimately cost about the same
          amount of time due to changes being needed after reviewing design from
