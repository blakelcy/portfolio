          I wanted to make sure there was a reference for CLC if I was no longer
          engaged with them.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">Outlined in the document were typography, color and spacing usages.
          Additional common components were called out so CLC was aware of what
          had already been created, hopefully reducing the creation of new one

        10 Usability Heuristics as a reference. Using this foundation I started breaking
        out the app by its different flows and screens. I identified the major flow:
        Login, Search, Hotel Details, and Booking. Alongside this flow were a multitude
        of one off screens that performed various status or administrative features
        for the user.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">From there I decided to break the flow into the four different micro
        flows and perform the analysis on each. I gave each screen in the flow a
        status; <strong>Good, Poor, Fail.</strong> From there I decided to break
        the flow into the four different micro flows and perform the analysis on
        each. I gave each screen in the flow a status;</p></div></section> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-n1jx5"><div class="paragraph col-cnt-2 svelte-n1jx5"><p class="svelte-n1jx5">After doing this for the entirety of the app I created a PowerPoint
        presentation to show to the client.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5"><strong>Findings.</strong> Overall the app was mostly in need of a fresh
        UI with more consistency between component usage. Some key issues of note
        were it was pretty poor at letting the user know what the error was, leading
        to frustrations. These frustrations were clearly shown in the app&#39;s reviews.
        Additionally there were components that looked like they were a button and
        yet it acted as a tab. What created further confusion was that there were
        other versions of tabs that made the interaction uncertain.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">In addition to the heuristic analysis, I created a set of concept
        mockups for the Search, Hotel Details, and Hotel Booking screens.</p></div> <img src="${t}/assets/figure1.png" alt="" class="svelte-n1jx5"/> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-n1jx5">Example slide from the Heuristic Analysis for CLC</figure></div> <div class="section-title svelte-n1jx5"><h3 class="svelte-n1jx5">Concept Mockups</h3> <div class="paragraph"><p class="svelte-n1jx5"><strong>Competitor Analysis.</strong> I decided since I didn’t have access
        to any users, I would have to rely more on my experience and the designs
        of other competitor apps. I downloaded and went through a myriad of apps:
        Hopper, Booking.com, Expedia, HotelTonight.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">I really liked how HotelsTonight’s search UI functioned as well as
        Booking.com, since they themselves had just done a redesign.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">Using these apps in conjunction with my analysis findings, I quickly put
        together some concept mocks, making sure to focus on spacing,
        typographical hierarchy and a modern consistency.</p></div></div> <div class="article-text img-col svelte-n1jx5"><div class=""><p class="svelte-n1jx5"><strong>Reaction.</strong> I presented the Analysis findings along with the

          the best estimate of how many screens there were and what the effort of
          each screen would be. I first created a sitemap of the app. From there
          I estimated the effort of each; SM - MD - LG. Once that list was complete
          and agreed upon with the Project Lead of CLC I set about creating repeating
          meetings to start discussing each part of the app.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">I first prioritized what I thought were the more important screens to
          update. This was done in part to let developers start working on some
          of the more critical logic changes as well as if budget or time ran
          out I had the more important screens updated. After talking with the
          PL, I wanted to make sure this was more of a refreshed UI rather than
          a complete overhaul. Some UX improvements may not be able to be
          implemented.</p></div> <img src="${t}/assets/figure3.png" style="max-width: 500px;" alt="" class="svelte-n1jx5"/> <figure class="img-figure-text svelte-n1jx5">Mural canvas for CLC discoveries (not all shown)</figure></div></div> <div class="article-text grid-col-3 svelte-n1jx5"><div class=""><p class="svelte-n1jx5">I lead the discovery sessions with support from Nia-Simone. The goal
        each time for me was to fully understand how that page or flow
        functioned, and if there were any hidden screens that I was not aware of
        due to permissions or certain criteria being met.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5"><strong>Development.</strong> As the lead I also was in charge of answering
        any questions our development team had. They had been building the app for
        CLC for some time so there was plenty of questions from them. To my knowledge
        there was never an active designer on the development team so there were
        a few hurdles to work through.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">As mentioned, my aim was not to affect too much of the current logic,
        but instead update UI were I could. Some changes were pushed back on
        from the development team but overall the changes were seen as an
        improvement that could be completed.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">Attending the SCRUM rituals became part of my tasks, walking through and
        sizing stories, attending standup, and answering questions on top of
        finishing out discovery sessions.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">Additionally I made sure to implement a design review meeting as a way
        to make sure the development team was transitioning to the new
        structure. Changes like spacing or typography were not adapted as
        quickly as color changes for them.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">Overall the team was progressing, albeit slowly. The decision was made
        to add on additional developers from my company to speed up the process.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">The design team was able to come in under budget which allowed for me to
        spend some additional time with the development team and stakeholder,
        making sure nothing was missed or inaccurately developed.</p></div></div>`,u,l,I=`<div class="section-title grid-col-3 svelte-n1jx5"><h3 class="svelte-n1jx5">Redesigned Mockups</h3> <div class=""><div class="col-cnt-2 svelte-n1jx5"><p class="svelte-n1jx5"><strong>A new UI.</strong> I created a lot of new components and UI elements
          for the redesign, however to save on time I chose to simply have user stories
          created for the smaller screens. In those stories I would call out the
          new UI pattern to be used with the correct spacing in place.</p> <p class="svelte-n1jx5">This worked well for the most part but ultimately cost about the same
          amount of time due to changes being needed after reviewing design from
