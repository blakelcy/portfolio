        by it’s different flows and screens. I identified the major flow: Login,
        Search, Hotel Details, and Booking. Alongside this flow were a multitude
        of one off screens that performed various status or administrative features

        heuristic I marked and explained why.</p> <p class="svelte-wrh2xk">After doing this for the entirety of the app I created a PowerPoint

        to frustrations. These frustrations were clearly shown in the apps reviews.
        Additionally, there were components that looked like they were a button for
        example, and yet it acted as a tab. However there were other UI versions
