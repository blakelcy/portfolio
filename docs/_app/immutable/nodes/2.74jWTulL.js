        a developer and a designer. From hospitals, to banks. Grocery stores to
        medical research groups and think tanks, I&#39;ve led a lot of discoveries
        with a lot of great people. My approach to design problems stems from my
        belief in collaborative ideation to create the best possible outcome for
        users and businesses. I invite you to read about my work below, where I
        found my passion for asking questions, analyzing feedback, and improving
        systems for businesses and customers. If you like what you see feel free
        to contact me. In my personal life, I love to visit National Parks and
        hike and camp in my home state of Ohio. This portfolio takes inspiration
        from early <a href="https://standardsmanual.com/products/parks" target="_blank">National Parks pamphlets and articles</a> and is created from scratch by me, using Figma and Svelte.</p>`;return{c(){e=f("section"),a=f("div"),s=f("h2"),r=H(i[1]),n=x(),l=f("div"),l.innerHTML=m,this.h()},l(o){e=h(o,"SECTION",{class:!0});var p=C(e);a=h(p,"DIV",{class:!0});var t=C(a);s=h(t,"H2",{});var c=C(s);r=N(c,i[1]),c.forEach(d),n=T(t),l=h(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),M(l)!=="svelte-1sho336"&&(l.innerHTML=m),t.forEach(d),p.forEach(d),this.h()},h(){v(l,"class","main-text-grid"),A(l,"gridFour",i[0]),v(a,"class","wrapper"),v(e,"class","svelte-r6uh9y")},m(o,p){g(o,e,p),y(e,a),y(a,s),y(s,r),y(a,n),y(a,l)},p(o,[p]){p&2&&q(r,o[1]),p&1&&A(l,"gridFour",o[0])},i:u,o:u,d(o){o&&d(e)}}}function O(i,e,a){let{gridFour:s=!1}=e,{title:r="Default"}=e;return i.$$set=n=>{"gridFour"in n&&a(0,s=n.gridFour),"title"in n&&a(1,r=n.title)},[s,r]}class W extends P{constructor(e){super(),F(this,e,O,B,L,{gridFour:0,title:1})}}function z(i){let e,a='<div class="hero-text svelte-1rm4r3a"><h1>Sr. Product Designer and Strategist</h1> <p>Celebrating over 10 years of product development and design.</p></div>';return{c(){e=f("section"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(s){e=h(s,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),M(e)!=="svelte-w54yhm"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){v(e,"class","hero-image svelte-1rm4r3a")},m(s,r){g(s,e,r)},p:u,i:u,o:u,d(s){s&&d(e)}}}class G extends P{constructor(e){super(),F(this,e,null,z,L,{})}}function U(i){let e,a,s,r,n,l,m,o,p;return e=new K({}),s=new G({}),n=new W({props:{title:"Consultancy Molds a Product Designer"}}),o=new E({props:{pamphlets:i[0].map(i[2])}}),{c(){w(e.$$.fragment),a=x(),w(s.$$.fragment),r=x(),w(n.$$.fragment),l=x(),m=f("section"),w(o.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(t){b(e.$$.fragment,t),a=T(t),b(s.$$.fragment,t),r=T(t),b(n.$$.fragment,t),l=T(t),m=h(t,"SECTION",{class:!0});var c=C(m);b(o.$$.fragment,c),c.forEach(d),this.h()},h(){v(m,"class","svelte-1vj9eq2")},m(t,c){k(e,t,c),g(t,a,c),k(s,t,c),g(t,r,c),k(n,t,c),g(t,l,c),g(t,m,c),k(o,m,null),p=!0},p:u,i(t){p||($(e.$$.fragment,t),$(s.$$.fragment,t),$(n.$$.fragment,t),$(o.$$.fragment,t),p=!0)},o(t){_(e.$$.fragment,t),_(s.$$.fragment,t),_(n.$$.fragment,t),_(o.$$.fragment,t),p=!1},d(t){t&&(d(a),d(r),d(l),d(m)),I(e,t),I(s,t),I(n,t),I(o)}}}function V(i){const e=[{title:"Kroger",role:"Product Designer",description:"Lead product designer for Krogerâ€™s Fresh Departments.
